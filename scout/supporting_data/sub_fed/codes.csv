It is a voluntary code aimed at helping buildings, contractors, and other industry professionals to design and build high-performance homes. It is based heavily on DOE’s Zero Energy Ready Homes (ZERHs) program and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Water Sense Program. These homes are built ready to incorporate on-site renewables and lower the carbon footprint of the home as well as save homeowners costs on utilities.
