proposed,"Massachusetts has drafted a Clean Heat Standard Framework. Specifically, the Massachusetts Clean Energy & Climate Plan for 2025 & 2030 (CECP) tasks MassDEP with developing a “a high-level program to meet the emissions limit for residential, commercial, and industrial heating” and identifies a Clean Heat Standard (CHS) as a regulatory option for addressing this requirement. 

The Massachusetts CHS draft framework includes two purposes: 1) to demonstrate a certain amount of GHG emission reductions from the use of heat pumps and other clean heat annually; and 2) to install a certain number of electric heat pumps annually, in line with the pace of electrification identified in the Clean Energy and Climate Plans (CECPs) for the state. Heating energy suppliers will use clean heat credits (CHCs or “checks”) to track the implementation and use of clean heat and, ultimately, to demonstrate compliance with the regulatory requirements set in the CHS.
